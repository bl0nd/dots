## The Hackiest of the Hackiest
*"Hello dotfile. Hello dotfile? That's lame. Maybe I should give you a name. But that's a slippery slope, you're only in my head, we have to remember that. Shit, this actually happened, I'm talking to an imaginary dotfile. What I'm about to tell you is top secret. A conspiracy bigger than all of us. There's a powerful group of dotfiles out there that are secretly running the world. I'm talking about the dotfiles no one knows about, the dotfiles that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%, the dotfiles that play Linus without permission. And now I think they're following me."*
